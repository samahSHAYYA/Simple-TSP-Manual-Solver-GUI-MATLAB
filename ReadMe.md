## Simple TSP Manual Solver GUI

### Overview

This GUI provides a simple interface for manually solving the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) with any given size of points.

It serves as an educational tool to visually grasp the complexity of TSP and
encourages learners to develop heuristic approaches to tackle it.

### How to Use

1. Familiarize yourself with the interface.

2. For educational purposes, try creating another GUI from scratch using MATLAB.
   Use this GUI as a reference, noting its imperfections and incompleteness.
   Aim to enhance its functionalities and adhere to best practices. **For
   inspiration, see SampleGUI.mp4 video.**

3. Explore heuristics and devise a method to compare them against brute force
   solutions. Note that brute force becomes impractical beyond 8 points due to
   computational expenses.

4. Instead of saving data into file, start thinking of how would you use a
   structured database such as MySQL to store TSPs. You can find in
   **mysql-scripts** folder a sample SQL script to create a database with
   few tables, constraints, procedures and triggers.

5. As a final step, in a production environment, you could use **Python**,
   **Django**, and **Django REST** to develop a wwb based solution. Also,
   you could choose to use non-structured databases such as MongoDB to store
   TSPs. In this aspect, we will be providing some basic solutions that can
   start with and then learn on your own.
