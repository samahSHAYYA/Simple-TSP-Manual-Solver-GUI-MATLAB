## Simple TSP Manual Solver GUI

### Overview

This GUI provides a simple interface for manually solving the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) with any given size of points.

It serves as an educational tool to visually grasp the complexity of TSP and
encourages learners to develop heuristic approaches to tackle it.

### How to Use

1. Familiarize yourself with the interface.

2. For educational purposes, try creating another GUI from scratch using MATLAB.
   Use this GUI as a reference, noting its imperfections and incompleteness.
   Aim to enhance its functionalities and adhere to best practices.

3. Explore heuristics and devise a method to compare them against brute force
   solutions. Note that brute force becomes impractical beyond 8 points due to
   computational expenses.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different strategies to solve TSPs
efficiently!
